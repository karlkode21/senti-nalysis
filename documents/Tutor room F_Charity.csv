Student,Does anything make it better or worse?,negative,-0.0516
Agent,Ibuprofen seems to help a bit—she’s less fussy and moves around a little more after I give it to her. Walking or standing makes it worse; she’ll limp and sometimes refuse to put weight on that leg. Resting seems to make her more comfortable.,positive,0.2484
